Grassland development follows the [git flow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) methodology.

There are a number of scripts that make this easier by bunding git commands into this workflow. We recommend [gitflow-avh](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh/wiki) with the following settings.
